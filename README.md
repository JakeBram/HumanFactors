# Human Factors
For Final Project Submission at TXST, for Human Factors of Computing Systems

For Juypter Notebook analysis, the user must install these python libraries- pandas, numpy, seaborn, sk-learn (optional).
This python code will import from the included csv files in the data folder. These can be modified or added to as necessary for future uses.
This code works by creating a dataframe, and selecting features of it to plot on a graph. These libraries translate well to machine learning for complex problems (here's where you could use sk-learn).
Juypter Notebook allows for 'markdown' boxes for the programmer to leave comments, in which I have documented my reasoning behind the code I have written, and how it works.
